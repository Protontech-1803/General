Trial Balance
A trial balance is a book keeping worksheet in which the balance of all ledgers are compiled into debit and credit account column totals that are equal.
 Trial Balance will be at your fingertips. You can prepare the Trial Balance periodically for your company, for example, at the end of a quarter or financial year. This will ensure that the entries in your books are mathematically correct. You can easily spot any errors or discrepancies, and make the necessary adjustments.

Closing stock: As per accounting principles, the Trial Balance will not display the closing stock. The closing stock is the balance of unsold goods that are left from the purchases made during an accounting period.
 The value of the total purchases is already included in the Trial Balance. If closing stock is included in the Trial Balance, then the effect will be doubled.
2. Receipt Notes in Trial Balance
When a receipt note is entered with a tracking number, it affects the Trial Balance.
