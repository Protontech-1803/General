# The Proxy Conflicts In Recruitment

A candidate is usually subjected to a number of tests before a company is confident in their
abilities, talents, and willingness to work for them. Only candidates who meet the
requirements of the company are considered. Candidates are frequently persuaded to use
illegal means to pass the exams due to the high level of competition. Some agencies have
begun to advertise services that allow the interviewee to skip the interview, taking advantage
of this weakness.

A &#39;proxy interview&#39; is a service in which someone else takes the test in place of the original
candidate. In today&#39;s world, hiring technical candidates is not only a challenge, but a shamble
of human beings who have descended to the lowest level of ethics. One such blunder is the
use of proxies for technical screening.

While working in the technical interviewing services industry today, I&#39;ve seen (and continue
to see) first-hand how low people will go to get through a technical interview.

I want to share you a Real Time experience which I have come across.

Our company received an application from &quot;X&quot; candidate for a position which we were
working on. The &quot;X&quot; drove the entire interview process, but on the joining date, surprisingly
&quot;Y&quot; had joined the company who was nowhere in the picture during the whole interview
process.

Though the whole interview process was done virtually, there was a live video recording the
whole process. I don&#39;t understand how the applicant believed that they could succeed in the
interview and can join without any hiccups.

Seriously, I&#39;m trying to visualise what is running in the mind of a candidate who uses a proxy
to clear an interview. Does the candidate consider how they will advance in their career if
they are caught even though they are chosen? Imagine if he/she is noticed to be a fraud...Is
the candidate aware of what they would be going through? Their professional life? Their
families and friends?

Everything will collapse in an instant. If you search for &quot;using proxies in interviews&quot; in a
search engine, you will find that several services are being offered by companies to conduct
proxy interviews, online videos showing you how to use a proxy to crack your interview,
prominent job boards advertising publicly for jobs to be a proxy candidate, and so on.

Here are some Scenarios of how malpractices are done.

- The candidate lip-syncs for the proxy who is speaking through a headset behind him, during
the interview.
- The proxy searches for answers using a search engine and sends the results to the actual
candidate via online instant messengers.
- The interview will be conducted by proxy using the name of the actual candidate who
applied, and the actual candidate will join the company after selection.

To get rid of the proxies in the recruitment, here are few strategies:
1. Before attending the Technical round, we may request that the candidate to submit Id
Proof. This allows us to determine whether the candidate who participated in the
interview call and the candidate who applied for the job are the same person.
2. After the candidate has completed the technical round, we may ask the candidate to
remain on the video call and then conduct a telephone interview to determine whether
the candidate who answers the phone and the candidate who gave the interview are
the same by comparing their face and voice.
